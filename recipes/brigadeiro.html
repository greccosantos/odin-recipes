    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiros are Brazilian chocolate truffles made out of only a handful of ingredients: sweetened condensed milk, butter, and any sort of flavoring. The most traditional one is the chocolate brigadeiro, and thatâ€™s what I will show you today!</p>
    <p>It's a popular confection throughout the country, especially for festive events. A brigadeiro is generally shaped into small balls covered in chocolate sprinkles and placed in a small cupcake liner. The mixture may also be poured into a small container and eaten with a spoon; this is known as a brigadeiro de colher (literally, "spoon brigadeiro").</p>
