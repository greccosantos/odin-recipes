    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meet Brazil’s ultimate crowd-pleaser: <em>brigadeiros</em>! Made with sweetened condensed milk, cocoa, and a touch of butter, they’re cooked into a rich, creamy fudge, then coated in sprinkles. They’re still one of my favorite desserts and the star of every Brazilian celebration.</P>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (14 oz or 397 g) of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (about 20 g) of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (about 14 g) of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>100 g (3.5 oz) of chocolate sprinkles</li>
        <li>20-25 small paper candy cups (size #5, about 1-inch diameter base)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine 1 can (14 oz or 397 g) of sweetened condensed milk, 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Cook over low to medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula, for about 15-20 minutes, until the mixture thickens and you can see the bottom of the pan for 2-3 seconds when dragging the spatula through it.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture onto a lightly buttered plate and let it cool at room temperature for about 3 hours, until firm and cool to the touch.</li>
        <li>Lightly butter your hands, then shape the cooled mixture into 1-inch balls (about 1-2 teaspoons each). Roll each ball in 100 g of chocolate sprinkles spread on a plate to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the sprinkle-coated balls in small paper candy cups (size #5) for serving.</li>
    </ol>
