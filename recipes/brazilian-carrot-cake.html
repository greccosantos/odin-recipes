    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This isn’t the carrot cake you’re used to - no raisins, no cream cheese, and no apologies. Brazil’s <em>bolo de cenoura</em> blends carrots into a smooth batter, baked into a moist cake and topped with a slick chocolate glaze. It’s the dessert you didn’t know you needed, pairing better with strong coffee than your average pastry does.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Carrot Cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>10 oz (283 g, about 2 cups chopped) peeled carrots</li>
        <li>3 large eggs (about 150 g total)</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 g) avocado oil</li>
        <li>1¾ cups (350 g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon (1.5 g) table salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (12 g) double-acting baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chocolate Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (170 g) semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips (50-70% cocoa)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (85 g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (40 g) light corn syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Carrot Cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper, ensuring an overhang for easy removal</li>
        <li>Place 10 oz peeled and chopped carrots, 3 large eggs, and 1 cup avocado oil in a blender. Blend on high for 1 minute until smooth, ensuring no carrot chunks remain. Add 1¾ cups granulated sugar and blend briefly (about 5 seconds) until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon table salt, and 1 tablespoon baking powder to the blender. Stir gently with a rubber spatula to partially incorporate, scraping the sides, then blend on low until the batter is smooth and evenly mixed with no lumps.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-40 minutes, checking at 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool in the pan until just warm to the touch, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chocolate glaze while the cake cools, then apply as directed below.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chocolate Glaze</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup chocolate chips, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, and 2 tablespoons light corn syrup in a double boiler (a heatproof bowl set over a pot with 1-2 inches of simmering water). Stir constantly until melted and smooth. Alternatively, microwave in a microwave-safe bowl in 20-second intervals, stirring between each, until smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove the glaze from heat and let it cool for 5-10 minutes until slightly thickened but still pour-able. Pour half the glaze over the just-warm cake, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Gradually add the remaining glaze, smoothing gently to avoid spillage, as the glaze thickens as it cools.</li>
    </ol>
